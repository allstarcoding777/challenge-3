# <Module-3-Challenge>

## Description

For this challenge, our job as students was to modify starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected. 

My motivation to complete this project was to not give up even when I got stuck. While completing this challenge, I learned how to use the prompt, confirm, and alert methods in JavaScript. 

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button to begin generating a randomized password.
